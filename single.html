                                    <p>Whenever I am looking for new ways to invest my curiosity meter is on overdrive. I pay close attention to the news, changes in economic trends, and... watch new Netflix documentaries. My wife and I are currently watching a Netflix series called, &#8220;Explained.&#8221; The topic of one of the episodes was on the high stakes and ethical controversies associated with gene editing. Maybe you've heard stories about a gene editing technique called CRISPR. This technique refers to a revolutionary technology used to modify DNA.</p>
                                    <br>

                                    <p>CRISPR – also known as CRISPR/Cas9 – is a system found in bacteria and is used for immune defence. &#8220;The bacteria uses CRISPR/Cas9 to cut up the DNA of invading bacterial viruses that might otherwise kill them.&#8221; Today this molecular technology is used for the purpose of changing any chosen letter(s) in an organism's DNA strand. For example, if one wanted to correct a disease-causing error that was inherited or developed over a period of time CRISPR technology would help us to do so.</p>

                                    <br>

                                    <p>Now... <i style="font-weight: 500;">why is this important?</i></p>

                                    <p>The first question I asked myself was,<i style="font-weight: 500;"> &ldquo;Are there any publicly traded companies dedicated to furthering this technology?&rdquo;</i> When I first learned of CRISPR technology, I became curious as to how it could work in other use cases. How would it be accepted and integrated into society? So I did some more research, which ultimately led me to a company working towards helping women with breast cancer. Long story short, this company's stock recently doubled after a scientific breakthrough after years of R&amp;D. I invested in this company before the surge in stock value even though I had very minimal knowledge of gene editing. Nevertheless, I was curious, asked the right questions, did my research and in turn, it paid off. (Pun intended)</p>

                                        <h2>Tip #2 - Look for Dividends.</h2>
                                    </div>

                                    <p><b>Exercising curiosity reaps persistence and persistence pays dividends.</b></p>
                                    <br>

                                    <p>Above is a featured snippet of the quarterly dividends paid out by McDonald’s Corporation to its shareholders.</p> <br>

                                    <p>In order to look for dividends we first need to understand what they are. Investopedia defines a dividend as, &ldquo;a sum of money paid regularly (typically quarterly) by a company to its shareholders out of its profits (or reserves).&rdquo;</p>
                                    <br>

                                    <p>If you’re exercising your curiosity your next question should be, <i style="font-weight: 500;"> &ldquo;why are dividends important?&rdquo;</i> Dividends are important when it comes to investing because it is extra money in your pockets and is a good indication of how a company is operating in terms of financial growth and stability.</p>
                                    <br>

                                    <p>After selecting my stocks, naturally, I wanted to put more of my money into the ones with the most growth potential/return. But why use my hard earned cash when I can just reinvest the money paid out from my dividends and fund new or existing investments. Simply put, dividends are important because they represent real cash flow.</p>
                                    <br>

                                    <p><i style="font-weight: 500;">&#8220;What has the company's growth looked like in the past year or so?&#8221;</i> This is a great question to ask oneself when looking into new investment opportunities. In case you're wondering, I have shares in McDonald's Corp (MCD), here's why. McDonald's is one of the most recognized establishments in the world. Some interesting facts: McDonalds opens a new restaurant every 14.5 hours; Mcdonald's restaurants feed 68 million people every day. This is more than the entire population of England. They are also the world's largest distributor of toys. Still not convinced? In 2008 when the financial crisis occurred, a time when most companies were on the downturn, McDonald's sales growth was greater in 2008 than it was in 2006 and 2007. While most were scaling down McDonald's scaled up, opening 600 new franchises in 2008. </p> <br>

                                    <p>Pretty impressive. A company that is recession proof may be a great long-term investment. People still had to eat. </p><br>

                                    <p>Sharing this information isn’t to convince you to buy McDonald's stock, rather, to demonstrate a company that has endured financial roadblocks and as a result pays great dividends. I’ve invested and so far, I'm lovin' it.</p><br>

                                        <h2>Tip #3 - Research.</h2>
                                    </div>

                                    <p><b>Research is formalized curiosity.</b></p>
                                    <br>

                                    <p>When I first started my investment journey, I bought stock in the Kraft Heinz Company (KHC). Please note, this is a S&amp;P 500 company backed by two investing giants 3G Capital and Berkshire Hathaway. Heinz is a big player in the Food processing industry, beverages, dairy, snacks, cheese, you name it they're in it. After learning about the importance of dividends, I learned that KHC paid cash dividends. <i style="font-weight: 500;">&#8220;A cash dividend is money paid to stockholders normally as part of the corporation's current earnings or accumulated profits&#8221;</i>. Based off of this initial information about KHC and what they were trading for at the time, this seemed like a great investment. Or so I thought.</p>
                                    <br>

                                    <p>Research is a process of finding not only information about potential companies to invest in, but finding systems, resources, and tools that will help you make informed investment decisions. </p>
                                    <br>

                                    <p>Yahoo Finance, for example, is a great tool when learning about the finances of a company you’re thinking of investing in. Github is also a great tool to learn about the technology behind a cryptocurrency you may be interested in. There are many great tools out there, but that’ll be another post for another day.</p>
                                    <br>

                                    <p>Upon visiting Yahoo Finance I looked into the finances of the Kraft Heinz Company and discovered some shocking stuff. I looked at the Cash Flow of the company for 2016 and ‘17. I took the total cash flow and subtracted the company's capital expenditures (money spent by a business or organization on acquiring or maintaining fixed assets, such as land, buildings, and equipment.)</p>
                                    <br>

                                    <blockquote class="margin-top-20 margin-bottom-40">
                                        <p><b>Total Cashflow from Operating Activities &minus; Capital Expenditures = Total Revenue</b></p>
                                    </blockquote>

                                    <p>This gives you the total revenue of the company for that period. Heinz reported revenue was in the negatives for 2017. This is important because a company paying dividends, but seeing negative revenue will more than likely have to cut dividend percentages to make up for the losses. This looks to be getting worse for Heinz. I eventually ended up selling my shares in the company. This experience taught me the importance of doing financial research into any company I invest in. </p>
                                    <br>

                                    <p>Do your research and give yourself the opportunity to make mistakes – make them quickly, then move on to your next venture. </p>
                                    <br>

                                    <p><i style="font-weight: 500;">&ldquo;What if I lose my money?!&rdquo;</i></p>
                                    <br>

                                    <p>If you're not familiar with the infamous Young Jeezy lyrics from the song <i style="font-weight: 500;">Scared Money</i>, please get familiar. The song goes on to explain that ultimately, <i style="font-weight: 500;">&ldquo;scared money, don't make no money.&rdquo;</i> This is important because if you're scared of losing money, your best bet is to put your money in a GIC for a couple years settling for a pretty bad interest rate. You'll get a guaranteed return, however, you end up having to lock your funds away until the end of your term. When you start investing, it's important to know your risk tolerance. Ask important questions before making an investment such as: <i style="font-weight: 500;">&#8220;is my principal protected? If not, what is the estimated rate of return and am I willing to take a loss when and if it occurs?&#8221;</i> Other good questions to ask are: <i style="font-weight: 500;">&#8220;What is the current revenue model?&#8221;</i> <i style="font-weight: 500;">&#8220;How does this company spend money?&#8221;</i> The more questions you ask, the better you can target your research.

                                    <p>If you're looking for a quick buck get into day trading – close this tab and move on. But if you're looking for long term financial growth, stocks can be a very rewarding investment option. The strategy I've used is Buy &amp; Hold. This refers to actively selecting stocks and holding on to them, ignoring the day-to-day fluctuations of that stock. For example, you bought that gene editing stock, a blog post comes out saying Rihanna is criticizing the company for gender biases – ignore, look at the facts and hodl.</p> <br>

                                    <p>So, what did I end up doing with the 5 figure return I received in May? While most will celebrate and splurge, I decided to continue building my wealth – reinvest. </p>
